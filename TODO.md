# What the chatbot needs to be able to do

- Needs a property for endpoint
- Show result of prompt
- Show additional information like other embeddings and their url
  - additional information only for last question, maybe as a popup
- Store history
- Send prompt without history to the server and receive results
- visualize results and history

## Phase 2

- Inform about privacy policy
  - User needs to accept before being able to prompt
  - Hide privacy information afterwards
  - Option for remembering the decision
  - Maybe a slot would be better for the legal text
  - Cookie options as property
- Needs labels propert to override labels
  - maybe a slot would be better
